# TO-DO_List

A todo list made using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS is a simple and effective way to organize and manage tasks. It provides a user-friendly interface where users can add new tasks, mark tasks as completed, and remove tasks as they are finished.

The HTML structure consists of an input field where users can enter their new tasks, an "Add" button to add the task to the list, and an unordered list (<ul>) where the tasks will be displayed. Each task is represented as a list item (<li>).

The CSS file is used to style the todo list, making it visually appealing and easy to navigate. You can customize the font, background color, padding, and alignment to suit your design preferences.
